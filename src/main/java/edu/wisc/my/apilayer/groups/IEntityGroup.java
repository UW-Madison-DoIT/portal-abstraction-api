/**
 * An <code>IEntityGroup</code> is a composite, or non-leaf <code>IGroupMember</code>.
 * It contains <code>IEntities</code> and other <code>IEntityGroups</code>.
 * <p>
 * The api defines methods for adding a member to, and removing it from, a group, 
 * though not vice versa.  (Although there is nothing to prevent a given <code>IGroupMember</code>
 * implementation from storing references to its containing groups.)  These methods only
 * change the group structure in memory.
 * <p>
 *   <code>addMember(IGroupMember gm)</code><br>
 *   <code>removeMember(IGroupMember gm)</code><br>
 * <p>
 * The following methods commit changes in the group structure to the
 * persistent store:
 * <p>
 *   <code>delete()</code> - delete the group and its memberships<br>
 *   <code>update()</code>  - insert or update the group, as appropriate<br>
 *   <code>updateMembers()</code> - insert/update/delete group memberships as appropriate<br>
 * <p>
 * The following methods were added to permit an <code>IEntityGroup</code> to function
 * within a composite group service:
 * <p>
 *   <code>getLocalKey()</code> - returns the key within the service of origin.<br>
 *   <code>getServiceName()</code> - returns the Name of the group service of origin.<br>
 *   <code>setLocalGroupService()</code> - sets the group service of origin.<br>
