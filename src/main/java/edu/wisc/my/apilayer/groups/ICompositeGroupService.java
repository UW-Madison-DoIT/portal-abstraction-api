/**
 * Defines an api for discovering entry points into a composite groups system

 * somewhat analogous to that of an <code>InitialContext</code> in JNDI.  Once
 * a client gets an <code>IGroupMember</code>, subsequent requests for navigating
 * the system or maintaining groups go thru the <code>IGroupMember</code> api 
 * and are serviced by the individual component services.
